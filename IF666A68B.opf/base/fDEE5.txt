Chapter VII Perfect Wisdom Guides the Other Perfections

How can those niyutas of kotis of born-blind, who are without a guide,Who are not conversant with the way, find an entran
ce to the city?Without wisdom these five perfections are eyeless:Those who are without the guide are unable to experienc
e enlightenment.

When they are taken hold of by wisdom,Then, having gained the eye, do they get that designation [i.e. ‘perfection’].It is
like a [religious] painting [of a deity or a saint] which is complete except for the eyes.Only after the eyes are paint
ed in does one get one’s fee.

The Attitude to Dharmas and to the SelfWhen one who develops wisdom to the end does not seize on the least dharma,Conditi
oned or unconditioned, dark or bright;Then one comes to speak in the world of the perfection of wisdom,[Which is like] s
pace, wherein nothing real whatsoever is established.

When he thinks, ‘I course in the wisdom of the Jinas,I will set free niyutas of beings touched by many ills’:This Bodhisa
ttva is one who imagines the notion of beings,And this is not the practice of wisdom, the foremost perfection.

Faith in the Perfection of WisdomThe Bodhisattva who has observed this foremost perfection,When in the past he served [th
e Buddhas], is learned and does not doubt:As soon as he has heard it he will again recognise the Teacher,And he will swi
ftly understand the Peaceful Calm of enlightenment.

Though in the past he has honoured millions of Buddhas, and served them,If without faith in the Jina’s perfection of wisd
om,Hearing of it, he will cast it away, one of small intelligence;After he cast it away, he will go to the Avici Hell, a
nd no one can save him.

Therefore, have faith in this Mother of all the Jinas,If you wish to experience the utmost Buddha-cognition:Let him be li
ke a merchant, who has travelled to the treasure island,And who, having lost his goods would [nevertheless] again return
[to it].
