Chapter XVIII Deep Stations

Deep are form, feeling and will,Consciousness and perception; signless in their essential original nature, and calm.Like 
one who tries to reach the bottom of the ocean with a stalk,So, when the skandhas have been considered with wisdom, one 
does not get to the bottom of them,

When a Bodhisattva thus understands that these dharmasIn the deep vehicle are in the ultimate sense stainless;Wherein the
re is neither skandha, nor sense-field, nor element,How can there be to him the attainment of his own merit anywhere?

The Simile of the WomanAs a man, preoccupied with matters of greed, had made a dateWith a woman, and would, not having me
t her, indulge in many thoughts;As many preoccupations as he would have [in his mind] during a day,For so many aeons doe
s a Bodhisattva strive to reach his goal.

Considerations of MeritIf a Bodhisattva would for many thousands of kotis of aeonsGive spotless gifts, and would equally 
guard his morality.And if another one were to preach the dharma associated with wisdom, the foremost perfection, -The me
rit from giving and morality would [by comparison] be infinitesimal.

When a Bodhisattva, having meditated on the foremost wisdom,Emerged therefrom [i.e. that meditation] preaches the stainle
ss Dharma,And turns over also [the merit from] that to the enlightenment linked to the weal of the world:There is nothin
g that is lovely in the triple world that could become equal to him.

And just that merit is declared to be just worthless,And likewise empty, insignificant, void and unsubstantial.Thus cours
ing he courses in the wisdom of the Sugatas.Coursing [thus] he acquires immeasurable merit.

No Growth or DiminutionAs mere talk he cognizes all these dharmasWhich the Buddha has demonstrated, practised and reveale
d.Though he may teach for many niyutas of kotis of aeons,Yet the Dharma-element does not get exhausted nor does it incre
ase.

And as to these five perfections of the Jinas.These dharmas also have been proclaimed as mere words.The Bodhisattva who t
urns over, without putting his mind to it,Does not fail; but he experiences the supreme Buddha-enlightenment.
