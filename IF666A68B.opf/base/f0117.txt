Chapter XIII Simile of the King and His Ministers

Who sees thus, he sees all dharmas.When the minister does everything, the king is evenminded.Whatever Buddha-actions ther
e are, whatever dharmas of the Disciples,It is the perfection of wisdom which effects them all.

A king does not travel to villages or into the countryside;But in his own home is the meeting-place where he assembles al
l:Just so the Bodhisattva does not move away from the dharmic nature of dharmas,But he assembles all the qualities in th
e Buddha-dharmas.
